# Scrapyard Hackclub Project: Hacker Hangman
The project that I did at Hackclub's Scrapyard in Silicon Valley. It's basically a Hangman game...but with a little twist...
If you get a letter wrong, the program will automatically choose a letter for you right after to LOWER your number of attempts, making it harder for you to win the game. 
If you get a letter right, the game will continue as normal. 

If the project is buggy, I'm really sorry, I only have like 2 weeks of HTML and I'm still a beginner at it. 

# How to run the Project: 
1) Add a "templates" folder into the file that you're running the game in (if it's not already there) and move your HTML File into it. If that's done, skip the step.
2) Run the game and click on the website that the game gives you.
3) Play the game
4) After you win or lose, hit the "play again" button and rerun the code. This will allow you to play again.
5) Play again as many times as you want.
